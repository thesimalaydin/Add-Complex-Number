# Complex Number Addition Application

This simple Java application demonstrates the addition of complex numbers.

## Description

The `Complex` class represents complex numbers with real and imaginary parts. The `main` method creates two instances of `Complex` objects, `n1` and `n2`, with specified real and imaginary parts. Then, it calls the `add` method to compute the sum of these complex numbers. Finally, it prints the result.

## How to Compile and Run

To compile and run this Java application using an IDE, follow these steps:

1. Open your Java IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, NetBeans).

2. Create a new Java project or open an existing one.

3. Add the `Complex.java` file to your project.

4. Build the project to compile the Java source files.

5. Run the `Main` class, which contains the `main` method, to execute the program.

## Output

The program will output the sum of the complex numbers in the format: `Sum = <real_part> + <imaginary_part>i`.

For example, if the input complex numbers are `2.3 + 4.5i` and `3.4 + 5.0i`, the output will be `Sum = 5.7 + 9.5i`.

## Sample Input and Output

Input:
n1 = 2.3 + 4.5i
n2 = 3.4 + 5.0i

Output:
Sum = 5.7 + 9.5i
